As you walk along, you suddenly find yourself face to face with a group of rebels.
They are armed and appear to be ready for a fight.
"Halt, traveler!" one of them calls out.
"I am {"rebelName"}, and by the authority of the {"cellName"}, I demand that you halt and prepare to be searched."
Do you:
1. Comply with their demands and halt?
2. Refuse to comply and try to fight your way out?
