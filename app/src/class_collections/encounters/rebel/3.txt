After a few moments of searching, the rebels are satisfied.
"Looks like he's clean," a rebel says.
The leader, who introduced himself as {"rebelName"}, nods.
"Thank you, {"rebelName2}," he says.
"Alright," he says, turning to you.
"You're free to go."
"Just as soon as you pay the liberation tax."
"Today's rate is, let's see..."
He looks you up and down, a calculating look in his eyes.
"{"extortion"} gold pieces."
You are surrounded, and it is clear that these rebels mean business.
Do you:
1. Pay the rebels the gold they demand?
2. Refuse to pay, and try to fight your way out?
