As you walk, you hear the sound of footsteps behind you.
You turn, and see a masked figure standing there, a sword in their hand.
"This way has a toll," they inform you, as you hear the sound of more footsteps approaching.
"We only require a small fee, and you can be on your way."
"A mere trifle, really," they continue, as you see more bandits emerge from the shadows.
"Of course, if you refuse to pay, we will have to take it by force."
"All we want is what is rightfully ours," they say, "just {"extortionPrice"} gold pieces."
You are surrounded, and it is clear that these bandits mean business.
Do you:
1. Pay the bandits the gold they demand?
2. Refuse to pay, and try to fight your way out?
