The scene as you entered the grand hall was one of pure pandemonium.
Aside from the soldiers at the gates to the hall, injured warriors were being carried in on stretchers by their comrades, and there were no healers in sight.
The Grandmaster was standing at the center of the room, his face a mask of fury.
It was the first time you had seen him since your induction into the Order, and you were struck by how much it seemed he had aged in the short time since then.
He alternated between barking orders at the soldiers and covering his mouth to Speak Words of Power.
You could neither hear nor see the effects of his Words, but you could feel the Power in the air.
It was a tangible thing, like a heavy fog that you could almost see.
The Grandmaster turned to you, his eyes blazing.
"Where are the others?" he demanded.
"Ignore that question," he said, knowing that you had no answer but would be compelled by the Third Oath to attempt one.
"Gather up the acolytes in your group and bring them to me at once!"
