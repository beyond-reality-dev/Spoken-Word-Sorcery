The scene as you return to the grand hall is one of devastation rather than mere chaos.
You suspect that your memory may be failing you again, as it seems like it must have been days since you were last here.
Then again, the Grandmaster is still there, at the center of the room.
He seems to be the center of the chaos, as well.
He is yelling in the air, not bothering to cover his mouth any longer.
Streams of lightning, an element far beyond your capacity to control, are arcing from his fingertips.
Rebels are scattered around the room, some of them lying on the ground, others trying to crawl away.
It appears that the Grandmaster decided to lure them into a trap before unleashing his power upon them.
