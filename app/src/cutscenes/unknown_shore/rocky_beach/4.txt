"Thank you for understanding," {"peasantName"} continued.
"Some mock me for my superstitions, but I know that the spirits are real."
"Anyway, I'm glad to see that you're alive."
"Most people who wash up on this shore are not so lucky."
"Now, I want to help you, but there's a bit of a complication," {"peasantName"} began.
"I see your robes, and I recognized the ring lying on the sand over there."
"You're a loyalist, aren't you?"
The answer seems obvious, but you hesitate.
Your Oath requires absolute loyalty to the Empire, but perhaps it has a caveat.
You swore to serve the Arcane Order and the Empire, as long as you "remain on this earth."
But the Citadel is an island, and you are no longer on the Citadel.
Does your Oath still bind you?
You know that a loophole in your Oath can be the difference between life and death, as you discovered fleeing the ruins of the Academy.
How do you respond?
1. "Yes, I serve the Emperor."
2. "No, I am just a traveler."
3. "What do you mean by 'loyalist'?"
