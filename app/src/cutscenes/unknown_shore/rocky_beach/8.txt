"Just someone who is loyal to the Empire, that's all," {"peasantName"} said.
He said it with a smile, but you understood the gravity of his words.
It was not a given that someone would be loyal to the Empire.
In fact, it was quite the opposite.
{"peasantName"}'s smile faded as he continued.
"This is not Imperial territory."
"The Empire has no power here."
"We were 'liberated' by the rebels a few years ago."
"It hasn't made much of a difference, though."
"They levied the same tax the Empire did."
"A 'temporary measure,' they said."
"But it's been years now."
He mentioned that the war had been going on for years, but you had been told that the war had only just begun.
It was no wonder that the Citadel had not received any reinforcements.
The Empire had been fighting a losing battle for years.
He paused, looking at you with a mix of pity and wariness.
"Anyway, I'm sure you have questions."
"But I'm not the best person to ask."
"I'm just a fisherman, and" {"peasantName"} hesitated.
"Given your clothing, I'm not sure I should be talking to you."
"I would suggest that you change your clothes and find a place to stay."
"There's a village to the west, by the name of {"villageName"}."
"You should be able to find some help there."
"Good luck, traveler."
With that, {"peasantName"} turned and walked away.
You watched him go, feeling a sense of unease.
You were no longer on the Citadel, and you were no longer under the protection of the Empire.
You were alone, and you had no idea what to do next.
You decided to follow {"peasantName"}'s advice and head to the {"villageName"}.
You hoped that you would find some answers there.
