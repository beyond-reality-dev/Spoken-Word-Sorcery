You feel the weight of the ring in your hand, and clasp it tightly.
You know what you must do.
You rear back, and throw the ring as far as you can into the ocean.
The ring glints in the sunlight as it flies through the air, and then disappears beneath the waves.
You watch it go, feeling a sense of finality wash over you.
You have made your choice, and you would stand by it.
This is who you are meant to be, regardless of the trials that lie ahead.
You stand, feeling a renewed sense of purpose, and begin to walk.
Congratulations on completing the prologue!
You have now unlocked the world map, and can access it from the map screen.
