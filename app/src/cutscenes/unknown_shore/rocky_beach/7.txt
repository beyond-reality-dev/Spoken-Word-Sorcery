"That's probably for the best," {"peasantName"} said.
"This is not Imperial territory."
"The Empire has no power here."
"We were 'liberated' by the rebels a few years ago."
"It hasn't made much of a difference, though."
"They levied the same tax the Empire did."
"A 'temporary measure,' they said."
"But it's been years now."
He mentioned that the war had been going on for years, but you had been told that the war had only just begun.
It was no wonder that the Citadel had not received any reinforcements.
The Empire had been fighting a losing battle for years.
He paused, looking at you with a mix of pity and wariness.
"Anyway, I'm sure you have questions."
"But I'm not the best person to ask."
"I'm just a fisherman, and" {"peasantName"} hesitated.
"Given your clothing, I'm not sure I should be talking to you."
"I would suggest that you change your clothes and find a place to stay."
"There's a village to the west, by the name of {"villageName"}."
"You should be able to find some help there."
"Actually," he added, "I can offer you something."
"Since you're not from here, you might need some help with the geography."
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small map.
It was a rough sketch, but it showed the general layout of the area.
He handed it to you.
"Good luck, traveler."
With that, {"peasantName"} turned and walked away.
You watched him go, feeling a sense of unease.
You were no longer on the Citadel, and you were no longer under the protection of the Empire.
You were alone, and you had no idea what to do next.
You decided to follow {"peasantName"}'s advice and head to the {"villageName"}.
You hoped that you would find some answers there.
Before you can leave, however, there is something you must do.
Or rather, a choice you must make.
You pull the ring out of the sand and examine it.
It is a simple band of silver, with the Imperial seal engraved on it.
It was a symbol of your loyalty to the Empire, and the Emperor.
But is it still?
You remember the words of your Oath, branded into your mind.
But you also remember the loophole that saved your life.
What do you do with the ring?
1. Keep it. Your loyalty, like the ring, is untarnished.
2. Leave it. Like you suspect the Emperor is, the ring will soon be buried beneath the waves.
