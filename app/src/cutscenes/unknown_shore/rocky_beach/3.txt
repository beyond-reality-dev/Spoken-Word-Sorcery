Despite your attempt at ignoring the figure, they continue to call out to you.
When you refuse to respond, they start to walk towards you.
You prepare yourself for a fight, but as they get closer, you realize that they are not a threat.

"Greetings!" the figure called out.
"I am {"peasantName"}," he continued. 
"I saw you wash ashore, but I didn't want to disturb you in case you were dead."
"Don't want any bad spirits or the like, of course."
"I'm sure you can understand that, can't you?"
