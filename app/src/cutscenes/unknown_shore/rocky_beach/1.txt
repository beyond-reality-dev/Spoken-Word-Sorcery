You awake to a bright light shining in your eyes. 
You blink, trying to clear your vision, and realize that you are lying on a rocky beach. 
The sun is high in the sky, and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore fills your ears.
You sit up, groaning as you do so, and take in your surroundings.
There is nothing but rocks and sand as far as the eye can see.
You don't know where you are, except that it's neither the Imperial Citadel nor Paragon.
You remember being hit by the boom on the ship, and then everything going dark.
You must have been thrown overboard during the storm.
You try to stand, but your legs are weak and unsteady.
You must have been unconscious for some time, and you are feeling the effects of it now.
You look around, trying to get your bearings, and see a path leading away from the beach.
You know that you need to find help, and that the only way to do so is to follow that path.
You take a deep breath, steeling yourself for the journey ahead, and begin to walk.
After only a few steps, however, you hear a voice calling out to you.
You turn, and see a figure standing on the beach, waving to get your attention.
Do you:
1. Approach the figure and see what they want?
2. Ignore the figure and continue on your way?
