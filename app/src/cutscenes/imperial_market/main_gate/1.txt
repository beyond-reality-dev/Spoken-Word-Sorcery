As you approach the main gate of the Imperial Citadel, you see a large group of rebels milling about.
They appear to have taken complete control of the gate, and are using it as a staging area for their operations.
You can see that they are armed and armored, and are clearly prepared for a fight.
Suddenly, a horn sounds from one of the gate towers, and the rebels quickly form up into ranks.
You see a figure emerge from the crowd, and you recognize him as one of the rebel leaders, marked by an orange cloth wrapped around his shoulder.
"Hello, citizen," he calls out to you, his voice carrying over the noise of the crowd.
"Do you wish to leave the city?" he asks, gesturing towards the gate.
"I would offer for you to join us, but we unfortunately cannot accept anyone from a liberated city to join so soon after the liberation."
You realize that you must make a decision quickly, as they have not yet recognized you as a member of the Arcane Order.
