The owner of the stall looks gratefully at you, as you offer a hand to help him up.
"Thank you," he says, as he dusts himself off. "I thought I was done for."
"It seems that the rebellion has won," he continues. "I don't know what I'll do now."
You look around at the other stalls, and see that they have all been looted.
Most of the rebels, other than the group of stragglers you just defeated, have long since moved on.
"I'm afraid that I can't offer you much," the stall owner says, "but please, take this as a token of my gratitude."
"I managed to hide a few coins before they came," he explains. "It's not much, but it's all I have left."
He hands you a small pouch, and you can feel the weight of coins inside.
"Thank you," you say as you take the pouch. "I will put it to good use."
The stall owner nods, and you can see the relief in his eyes.
"Good luck," he says, as you turn to leave.
