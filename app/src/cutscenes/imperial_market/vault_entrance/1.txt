Several guards turn to face you as you approach the entrance to the Imperial Treasury's vaults.
Some of them remain facing the door, which is sealed with a massive lock.
It seems odd that the guards would be facing the door, rather than the area in front of it.
You can't help but wonder if they're guarding the door from something inside the vaults, rather than from intruders outside.
As your thoughts trail off, one of the guards begins to address you.
"We received notice that someone was being sent to retrieve an item from the vaults," he says.
"Is that you?"
