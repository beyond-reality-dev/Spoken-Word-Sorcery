As you approached the mighty gates of Paragon City, you heard a horn sound.
You had been spotted.
The gates opened, and a group of guards emerged.
They surrounded you, weapons drawn.
Then, they did something unexpected.
They knelt before you, and one of them started to speak.
"Hail, {"name"}!" he shouted. "We have been eagerly awaiting your arrival."
"Hail, {"name"}!" the other guards echoed.
"Glory to the Last Speaker!" the first guard cried.
"Glory to the Last Speaker!" the others repeated.
"Glory to the Grandmaster of the Arcane Order!" the first guard continued.
"Glory to the Grandmaster of the Arcane Order!" the others chanted.
"Glory to the heir of the Empire!" the first guard proclaimed.
"Glory to the heir of the Empire!" the others shouted.
They stood, and the first guard stepped forward.
"I am Captain {"leaderName"}, commander of the {"entrance"} Guard," he said.
"Even after the Emperor's death, we have kept the faith," he continued.
"We did not abandon the cause, because we knew that one day, someone would come to restore the Empire to its former glory."
"And now, that day has come."
{"leaderName"} looked at you with hopeful expectation.
"Are you the one who will lead us to victory?" he asked.
What do you say?
1. "You are mistaken. I am not who you have been waiting for."
2. "I am who you think I am. I have come to reclaim the Empire."
