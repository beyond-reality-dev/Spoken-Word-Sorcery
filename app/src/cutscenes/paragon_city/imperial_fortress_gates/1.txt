"Halt!" one of the guards shouted.
"Do you know where you are?" he demanded, rhetorically.
"You are at the gates of the Imperial Fortress," he continued.
"Where the Governor has resided since the fall of the Empire."
Of course, you expected this.
While the Citadel intentionally restricted members of the Order from knowing too much about Imperial politics, Paragon City was well known.
Like the Citadel, it did not spring up organically.
It was built by the Empire, and eventually became the last bastion of the Empire's power.
The Governor of Paragon City did not officially hold power beyond the city's walls, of course, but the Emperor's death had left a power vacuum.
And the Governor was the most powerful person left.
The guard continued.
"And this is obviously a time of heightened security," he said.
"The very fact that you are here is suspicious."
"Who are you, and what is your business here?"
1. "I am {"name"}, and I have come to speak with the Governor."
2. "I am {"name"}, and I have come to reclaim the Empire."
3. "I am {"name"}, and I have no business here"
4. "I am {"name"}, and I have come to kill the Governor."
