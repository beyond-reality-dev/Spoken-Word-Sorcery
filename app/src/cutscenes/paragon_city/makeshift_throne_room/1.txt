As the guards escort you through the gates into the grand hall of the Imperial Fortress, you can't help but feel a sense of trepidation.
This is where it will all end, one way or another.
As you walk further down the hall, you realize that the carpet beneath your feet has been recently dyed purple.
The color of royalty.
The more obvious sign of the Governor's ambitions, however, is the throne at the end of the hall.
It is a makeshift throne, but by no means a humble one.
It is adorned with gold and jewels, and the backrest is emblazoned with the Imperial Seal.
The Governor himself is seated upon it, looking every bit the part of a king.
And perhaps soon he will be.
He gestures for you to approach.
"Welcome, {"name"}," he says.
"I have been expecting you."
"You see, while your exploits have been impressive, they have also been quite disruptive."
"And I cannot allow that to continue."
"It is time for you to end this charade and accept your place in the new order."
"Now, kneel before me, and swear your loyalty to the Empire."
"And to your new Emperor."
1. Acquiesce and kneel before the Governor.
2. Refuse to kneel and challenge the Governor.
