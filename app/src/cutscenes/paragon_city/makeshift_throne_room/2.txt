The Emperor beams at you, his eyes filled with pride.
"Rise, {"name"}," he says, knowing that his victory is at hand.
"Rise as the new Governor of Paragon City, humble servant of the Empire!"
The Emperor's words echo through the chamber, and the guards present erupt into cheers.
Even those who had once supported you to be the Emperor yourself do not dare speak.
The Emperor raises his hand, and the room falls silent.
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Paragon City campaign!
