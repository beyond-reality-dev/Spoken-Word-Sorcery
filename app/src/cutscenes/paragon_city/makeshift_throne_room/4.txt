As you stand up over the fallen body of the Governor, you know the world will never be the same.
The guards at the gates of the fortress, who had been rushing to the Governor's aid, now stood frozen in shock.
You could see the fear in their eyes, and you knew that they would not dare to challenge you.
You had done the impossible.
You had killed the Governor, who sought to make himself Emperor.
And in doing so, you had saved Paragon City from his tyranny.
The people would remember this day.
And most importantly, they would remember you.
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Paragon City campaign!
