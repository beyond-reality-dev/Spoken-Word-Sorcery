The rebels lay littered around you, devastated by your attacks.
But as you looked around, you realized your allies were on the ground too.
In the chaos of the battle, you didn't even see them fall.
You rushed to the nearest acolyte, but it was too late.
If you knew healing Words, perhaps you could have saved them, but you were still early in your training.
You could only watch as the life left their eyes.
There was nothing else you could do.
After waiting for a moment, you were reminded of your mission.
You had to inform the Grandmaster of the breach, that ambushes were being launched in the Academy, and that the weapons had already been seized.
It was strange that the Grandmaster, with all his power, had not already sensed the danger.
But you knew you had to hurry back and warn him.
