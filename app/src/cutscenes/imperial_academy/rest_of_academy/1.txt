As you push open the doors, they clatter to the ground, broken and splintered.
Moonlight streams in through the collapsed roof, casting a pale light on the scene before you.
The smoke here is a little less oppressive, but the smell of burning wood is still strong.
You walk a little farther, carefully stepping over hot embers and fallen warriors, and then stop dead in your tracks.
You feel the Power in the air.
It's faint, like a drop of water in comparison to the Grandmaster's storm, but unmistakable nonetheless.
You do not have the skill to determine where it is, or who the source is, but you figure that it can't be far.
Overall, the Power is good news.
The rebels lack it, so it's almost certainly Imperial.
After wandering the wreckage for what feels like hours, though it is likely only minutes, you find the source.
He's an Imperial Adept, slightly more advanced than you, with a name that you have forgotten, huddled over a small orb of greenish fire.
Without looking at you, he carelessly mutters a few words under his breath, and the fire grows larger.
He then gestures at it, still staring at the flames, and you take a seat.
"I suppose you would like to know what happened?" he asks.
