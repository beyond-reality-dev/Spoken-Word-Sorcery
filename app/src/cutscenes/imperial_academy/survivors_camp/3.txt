The survivor, who you know recognize as a master Speaker, leans in closer.
"The Codex withstood the attack?"
You nod, and the Speaker's eyes widen.
"This is great news. The Codex is the key to our survival. With it, we can rebuild the Empire."
The Speaker looks around at the other survivors, who are now listening intently.
"This acolyte has been charged with protecting the Codex. We must help them in any way we can."
The survivors nod in agreement, and the Speaker turns back to you.
"You must go at once to the Imperial Palace and bring the Codex to the Emperor. He will know what to do."
