The guard laughed and shook his head.
"Do you really think we will permit an audience with the Emperor to anyone who simply walks up to the palace gates?" he asked.
You try to explain that you are a member of the Arcane Order, but the guard is not convinced.
"I have it on good authority that every member of the Arcane Order, save one that warned us of the attack, was put to the sword by the rebellion," he said.
"Even the Grandmaster himself was slain in the attack."
You try to protest, but the guard is not swayed.
"How about this," he said. "If you can prove to me that you are a loyalist, I will let you pass."
He hands you a small piece of paper, and you see the Imperial Seal stamped on it.
"Go to the Imperial Treasury and show them this," he said. "It will grant you entry."
"Then, retrieve the Emperor's belongings, and bring them to me."
"I have been told that they are guarded by an enchantment, to ensure that only a Speaker of the Arcane Order can access them."
"That should be proof enough for me."
You nod, and take the paper from him.
"Good luck," he said, waving you away.
