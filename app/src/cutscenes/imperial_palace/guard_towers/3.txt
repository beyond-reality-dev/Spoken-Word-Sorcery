"Halt!" the guard cries out again.
"By the authority of the Emperor, I command you to stop!"
Your body goes rigid after hearing the guard's words.
Once it is clear that the orders come from the Emperor himself, albeit indirectly, you stop in your tracks.
The Oaths require nothing less.
"Now," the guard continues, "by the Emperor's command, you will answer my question."
You cannot refuse the order, and you quickly explain that you are a member of the Arcane Order.
The guard's eyes widen in surprise.
"Is that so?" he asks, his voice softening.
