As you walk towards the guard towers in front of the Imperial Palace, you see a group of guards standing at attention.
They are armed and armored, and you can see the determination in their eyes.
"Halt!" one of them calls out, his voice stern.
"What is your business here?" he asks, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword.
Do you:
1. Tell them that you are a member of the Arcane Order, and that you have come to speak with the Emperor.
2. Refuse to answer their question and continue walking towards the palace.
