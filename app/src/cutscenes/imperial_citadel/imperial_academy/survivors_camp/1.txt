As you step outside the smoldering ruins of the Imperial Academy, you are hit by a sense of disgust.
The stench of death and decay is overwhelming, and the once proud academy is now a graveyard.
You see a group of survivors huddled together, mired in despair.
They look up at you with hollow eyes, and you can see the fear and hopelessness in their faces.
Is this really the fate of the Empire?
You feel a surge of anger and determination.
You must save the rest of the Empire, but first you must learn what is happening outside the academy.
You approach the survivors, who stand up suddenly as they see you.
They eye you warily, unsure of your intentions.
"Who are you?" one of them asks, his voice hoarse.
