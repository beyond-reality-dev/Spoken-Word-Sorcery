Although you are worried about the fate of the port, you try to relax in the hold's hammock.
It is no small task, however, as the sound of fighting draws closer.
You can hear the clash of steel on steel, the cries of the wounded, and the roar of the flames.
You can't help but wonder if this is the end of the Empire, and the only home you can remember.
You close your eyes, and try to block out the noise, but it is no use.
After what feels like hours, you hear the sound of marching feet, and hear a renewed flurry of activity on the deck above.
The Emperor has arrived.
You can hear his voice, booming and commanding, as he gives orders to the crew.
The ship begins to move, and you can feel the deck beneath you shift as it sets sail.
You can't help but feel a sense of relief, as the ship moves away from the burning Citadel.
Somehow, you have survived, and you are on your way to safety.
Or at least as safe as you can be on a warship, fleeing the ruins of a capital destroyed by rebellion.
Perhaps Paragon will be more secure, you think, as you drift off to sleep.
Or perhaps this is just the beginning of the end.
You must rest to continue...
