You awake to the sounds of shouting and a furiously rocking warship.
You struggle to get your bearings, and remember that you are in the cargo hold of the Imperial Dreadnought.
There are broken crates and barrels everywhere, and the door to the hold is wide open.
You stand up out of the hammock but are thrown to the floor as the ship lurches violently.
You decide to make your way to the deck to see what is happening.
