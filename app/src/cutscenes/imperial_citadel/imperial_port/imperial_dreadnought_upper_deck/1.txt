The upper deck of the ship is chaotic, but an organized chaos. 
The crew is moving with purpose, securing the ship for departure. 
The captain stands at the helm, barking orders to his crew, already forgotten your presence.
You can see the sails being unfurled, the ballistae being loaded, and the anchor being raised.
You can tell that as soon as the Emperor is aboard, the ship will set sail.
A sense of unease hangs in the air, as you realize that smoke is rising again from the Citadel.
The rebels have returned, and they appear to be trying to block the ship's departure.
The guards at the port's gate appear to be holding them back, but it is hard to tell at this distance.
You can see the captain looking at you, and he gestures for you to approach.
"Don't worry about the rebels," he says. "We've got a job to do, and we're going to do it."
"Head below deck and go to the cargo hold," he continues. "That will be your quarters for the journey."
As you begin to protest, he cuts you off.
"I don't have time for this," he says. "The Emperor will be here soon, and we need to be ready to leave."
"You can't help us with the battle, you're too far away and any spells will alert the rebels, if they don't already know it, that the Emperor is nearly here."
"And if you're complaining about the quarters, frankly, I don't care. This is a warship, not a pleasure cruise."
