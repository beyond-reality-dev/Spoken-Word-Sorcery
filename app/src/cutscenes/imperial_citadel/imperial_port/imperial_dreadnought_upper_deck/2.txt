As you stagger up the stairs to reach the upper deck, you hear the wind roaring and feel the waves crashing against the bow of the boat.
Crew members are running back and forth,  trying to keep the ship on course.
The captain is commanding his crew, his voice booming over the sound of the wind and waves.
It seems that the ship has been caught in a flash storm, and the crew is struggling to keep it afloat.
You can see the sails being torn to shreds by the wind, as crew members try desperately to furl them. 
The mast is creaking ominously, struggling to stay upright in the face of the storm.
Even the captain, a seasoned sailor, looks worried as he barks orders to his crew.
You can see the fear in their eyes, as they struggle to keep the ship from capsizing.
Then, in an instant, the storm reaches its peak.
The wind howls, the waves crash against the ship, and the crew is thrown about like rag dolls.
You can feel the ship lurching beneath you, as it is tossed about by the storm.
The captain is still shouting orders, but his voice is increasing lost in the chaos.
You can feel the ship beginning to tilt, and you know that it is only a matter of time before it capsizes.
The crew is beginning to panic, and you can see them abandoning their posts in a desperate bid to save themselves.
You realize that the Emperor is still below deck, likely unaware of how dire the situation has become.
You hear a loud crack, and see the mast splintering in two.
The ship is doomed, and there is nothing you, or anyone else, can do to save it.
Fully aware of your duty to the Emperor, you struggle to make your way below deck to warn him of the impending disaster.
Before you can reach him, however, the ship lurches violently, and you are thrown off your feet.
A piece of the mast swings towards you, and you realize that you will need all your strength to survive.
