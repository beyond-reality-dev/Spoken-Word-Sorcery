As you gaze upon the massive warship, you can't help but feel a sense of awe.
It is a truly impressive sight, with its sleek lines and massive ballistae.
The ship is a testament to the might of the Empire, and you can't help but feel a swell of pride in your chest.
Although, that pride is somewhat tarnished by the knowledge that this is a retreat rather than a show of strength.
As you approach the gangplank, you can see the crew scurrying about, preparing for departure.
The captain stands at the top of the gangplank, his arms crossed over his chest.
He looks you up and down, and you can see the skepticism in his eyes.
That skepticism fades, however, as he notices the ring on your finger.
"Ah, the Last Speaker," he says, his voice gruff. "Welcome aboard."
Before you can question the new title, he gestures for you to follow him.
