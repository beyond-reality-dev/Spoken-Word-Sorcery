"Do you have the Emperor's belongings?" the guard asks skeptically as you approach him.
You nod, and the guard's eyes widen in surprise.
"Really?" he asks, still unconvinced. "Let me see them."
You hand over the Emperor's belongings, and the guard inspects them carefully.
After a moment, he nods in satisfaction.
"Very well," he says. "You may pass."
He steps aside, allowing you to enter the palace grounds.
