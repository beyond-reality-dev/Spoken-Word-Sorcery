As you walk alongside the purple carpet of the throne room (as none but the Emperor is permitted to walk on top of it), you feel a sense of awe.
The room is vast, and the ceiling is so high that you can barely make out the intricate carvings that adorn it.
The walls are lined with tapestries, each one depicting a different scene from the history of the Empire.
The carpet is covered in a thick layer of dust, and you can see the footprints of the Emperor leading up to the throne.
You can almost feel the weight of his power in the air, and you know that you are in the presence of greatness.
You approach the throne, keeping your eyes downcast, and kneel before it.
The throne itself is a massive structure, made of gold and encrusted with jewels.
The back of the throne is carved with the Imperial seal, and you can see the Emperor's name written in gold letters.
You can feel the eyes of the Emperor on you, and you know that you must speak.
"Your Majesty," you say, your voice barely above a whisper. "I have brought the items you requested."
You reach into your pack and pull out the purple bag that you found in the hidden tunnel.
You carefully place it on the ground in front of the throne, and wait for the Emperor's response.
There is a long pause, and then you hear the sound of footsteps approaching.
You look up, and see the Emperor standing before you.
"Rise," he says, his voice deep and commanding.
You stand, and bow deeply.
The Emperor picks up the bag, and opens it.
"Everything is here," he says, his voice tinged with satisfaction.
"Now, follow me into my chambers. There is much to discuss."
