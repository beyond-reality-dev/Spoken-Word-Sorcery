"Excellent," he says as he places the Imperial Signet Ring on your finger. 
"You have proven yourself to be a loyal servant of the Empire," he continued. 
"Wear this ring with pride, and let it be a reminder of your duty to myself and the rest of the Empire."
He stands, and you follow suit.
"Now, let us begin," he says. "There is much work to be done."
"We must make our way to Paragon, one of the last remaining strongholds of the Empire."
"From there, we can begin to plan our next move."
"Go to the port and board the Imperial Dreadnought," he says. "I will meet you there shortly."
"Your ring will grant you access, so do not worry about any resistance you may encounter."
"I will not forget your service to the Empire," he says as he opens the door.
"And, the Empire will soon require a new Grandmaster," he says with a smile.
"Perhaps you will be the one to take up the mantle."
He gestures for you to leave, and you do so, the weight of the ring on your finger a constant reminder of the task ahead.
Also in the back of your mind is the realization that he did not mention the Codex even once.
