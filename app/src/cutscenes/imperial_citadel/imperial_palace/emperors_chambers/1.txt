As you follow the Emperor to his chambers, he shuts the door behind you, and gestures for you to sit.
"You have done well," he says, as he takes a seat behind his desk.
"Despite the chaos that has engulfed the Citadel, you have remained loyal to the Empire."
He looks at you, his eyes piercing.
"And despite the complete and utter failure of the Imperial Guard, the Arcane Order, and the Grandmaster himself, you have succeeded where they have not."
He leans back in his chair, and clasps his hands together.
"I imagine this is not how you expected me to greet you," he continues. "But I must be honest with you."
He pauses, and you can see the weight of his words in his eyes.
"The Empire is in grave danger," he says. "The rebels have effectively destroyed the Citadel."
He gestures to the window, and you can see the smoke rising from the ruins of the Academy.
"The Grandmaster is dead, the Treasury has been looted, and almost every ship has fled the harbor."
"The rebels may have retreated for now, but they will return, and when they do, they will be stronger than ever."
He looks at you, and you can see the determination in his eyes.
"I will not let the Empire that my ancestors built fall to these traitors," he says.
"But I cannot do it alone."
He leans forward, and you can see the fire in his eyes.
"I need you," he says. "I need you to help me rebuild the Citadel, to restore order to the Empire, and to defeat the rebels once and for all."
He reaches into his desk, and pulls out a small, ornate box.
He opens it, and inside you see a small, silver ring, in the shape of the Imperial seal.
"This ring has been passed down through the generations of my family," he explains.
"It is a symbol of loyalty, of honor, and of duty to the Empire."
He hands you the ring, and you can feel the weight of it in your hand.
"Will you accept this ring?" he asks.
