As you walk further down the dim tunnel, you realize there is a very slight, but noticeable, incline.
The walk is cut short, however, as you come to a dead end.
The tunnel is blocked by a large pile of rubble, and you can see no way to proceed.
"This must not have been part of the original vault," you think to yourself.
"No real Imperial would have built a tunnel of this shoddy construction."
This must have been a recent addition, and it seems that the rebels were trying to dig their way into the vault.
During their hasty escape after their highly successful raid, it must have collapsed on them.
All is not lost, however.
You can see a purple bag sticking out from under the rubble.
It must belong to the Emperor, and it is your duty to retrieve it.
You begin to dig through the rubble, and after a few minutes of hard work, you manage to uncover the bag.
You carefully brush off the dirt and debris, and place it in your pack.
You don't dare open it here, but you know that it must contain something of great value.
