"These are the Three Oaths, which every prospective member of the Order must swear to."
"Even if you lose yourself, you shall never harm our great Empire because of the Power of these memories."
At that moment, you realized the truth in this statement.
Even if you wanted to, a reason for which you cannot fathom, you could not raise a hand against the Order or the Empire it protects.
You felt an adoration for the Order and the Empire, and particularly for the Grandmaster who you surmised is the man standing before you, that goes beyond anything you had ever felt before, even more so than that of your parents.
"Strange," you thought to yourself. "What were their names again?"
You shook your head, trying to clear it.
You could still see their faces at that point, but their names were already lost to you.
You felt a pang of sadness at this, but it quickly fades.
You had a greater purpose than they could have ever imagined.
