Immediately after you finished Speaking, a roughly circular shimmer in the air formed in front of you, before dissipating as quickly as it had arrived.
"Now it is time for me to teach you some more advanced techniques," the teacher started. "First, you will combine your elemental Word with that of your weapon to make it form physically in this world."
"This, however, is dangerous. If you simply say the Words, without a direction, it could backfire and hurt you."
"That is why I will now teach you another Word, <i>Away</i>. This Word will make your spell go away from you, instead of forming in front of you."
"Try it now. First, turn in any direction away from me. Then, say the element Word, followed by the shape Word, and then the direction Word."
"Actually, on second thought, why don't you describe exactly what you'll do, before you actually do it."
"You can start by saying 'I' if you want to, and then describe your actions, although that part is up to you."
"You can say something like 'look,' or 'turn,' and then say a direction like 'left,' or 'right.'"
"Then describe the spell, making sure to use 'and' in between the clauses in the same sentence."
"You can tell me that you 'say,' or 'speak,' followed by the spell phrase."
