It was a long time ago, the first time you Spoke.
Early one morning, you awoke to the sound of horses galloping on the cobblestone streets of your village.
Hooded figures sat atop each one, cloaked in shadowy garments that seemed to almost fade into the low light of dawn.
A knock on the door startled you, and you quickly dressed and made your way to the front of the house.
One of the hooded figures had dismounted, and was talking to low voices with your parents.
You know they were once clear as day, outlined by the flickering torches that lined the streets, but you cannot remember their faces.
The cost of the Power.
You cannot remember what they said, nor much of what happened after they left.
But you know that you went with them, and that you never returned.
At least as far as you can remember.
The next impression you have is of a large, dark chamber, the walls lined with members of the Order.
None wore hoods, but most of their faces shift in your memory, as if they were made of smoke.
The one who spoke to you, however, is ingrained in your memory.
They made sure of that.
"What is your name, young acolyte?" he demanded.
