"How does it feel, the Power coursing through your veins?"
"I promise you, the Power is worth its cost."
The next memories you have are of several years later.
You have not yet learned any new Words, but have grown strong in the Words you do know.

"They've breached the walls!" he shouted.
"Slow down. Who has breached the walls?" your teacher demanded. He was not the same teacher that you had several years ago. At some point he had been replaced. Perhaps after a battle. You cannot remember.
