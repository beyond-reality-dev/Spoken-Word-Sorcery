It appears that the mystical field supposedly protecting an artifact with unparalleled power was a mere illusion.
You carefully walk forward, and pick up the Codex off its pedestal.
It is a heavy tome, bound in worn leather and covered in golden symbols.
You gingerly flip through the pages, and are surprised to find that they are blank.
Perhaps this is a decoy, or perhaps the Codex was never real to begin with.
Either way, you realize with trepidation, your mission is not over.
You must find the real Codex.
Whether or not it exists is immaterial.
