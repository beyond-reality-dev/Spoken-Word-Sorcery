"Yes, very good!" he praised you.
"How does it feel, the Power coursing through your veins?"
"I promise you, the Power is worth its cost."
The next memories you have are of several years later.
You have not yet learned any new Words, but have grown strong in the Words you do know.
But at that moment of your last recollection, everything changed.
A young trainee, barely older than you, burst into the training room, his face pale with fear.
"They've breached the walls!" he shouted.
"Slow down. Who has breached the walls?" your teacher demanded. He was not the same teacher that you had several years ago. At some point he had been replaced. Perhaps after a battle. You cannot remember.
"The rebellion, I think" the trainee answered, uncertain.
The teacher covered his mouth, the telltale sign of a Speaker who didn't want to be heard.
"Wake the others," he ordered. "We must prepare."
"Along the way, head to the armory and grab a weapon."
Seeing your surprise, he explained, "Our enemies do not collapse, exhausted, after only a few swings of a sword."
"Our Words are our weapons, but they are not the only weapons we have."
"And I fear that we will need all the weapons we can get."
The training room is a large room with a few training dummies and a practice wooden staff on the wall. There is a door to the north, leading to the common room, a door to the east, leading to the practice yard, and a door to the west, leading to the storage room.
