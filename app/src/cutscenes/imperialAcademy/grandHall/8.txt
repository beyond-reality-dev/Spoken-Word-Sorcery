You eventually awake to the smell of smoke, the sound of crackling flames, and the uncomfortable feeling of heat on your skin.
You crawl out from under a stone table that apparently had fallen above you, mere inches from breaking every bone in your body.
You slowly stand up, and look around.

Nor any Imperial, for that matter.
You can't help but wonder what happened to them.
You also can't help but wonder what happened to you.
You're a bit shaken up, but you decide to leave the grand hall and see if you can find any answers.
